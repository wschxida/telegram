It makes every user who withdraws money ponder, \u201cShould I withdraw now if I can withdraw more in just 8 minutes?\u201d. It must be the most agreeable \u201cheadache\u201d one could have. \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude1c  Over to the news now! \n \n1. We now have 5,000 users!  \ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\ude0e\nNew users are actively joining us. It took a little over a week to see the number of users grow twofold: from 2,5000 to 5,000. Way to go, leaders! If we keep this up, we'll surely win the entire world!\n \n2. The step-by-step guideline on the quick start on ELDORADO is ready now. \u2705\u2b50\nWe've prepared a detailed, step-by-step guideline with screenshots on how you can start on ELDORADO. It describes, among other things, how to create a SPA address, join ELDORADO, buy coins and make a donation. You can perform all these actions using one of two methods: on the SIGEN platform or via the official SPARTA wallet. In other words, all you need is now available on a single page. Now you can easily start using the System. Use the guideline when you invite new users to join and use it yourself if you've just joined us.\nhttps://eld.club/quick-start.html \n \n3. Cryptocurrencies celebrate a 10-year anniversary! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude4c\nOne can hardly believe it's been 10 years since the inception of Bitcoin. In its earliest days, it cost nearly nothing and very few believed in it, but it managed to prove itself to the entire world. SPARTA that we use for donations on ELDORADO is also at its initial stage of development, and its price is quite low. However, this fledgling cryptocurrency has a huge potential and some serious advantages over Bitcoin: it's a lot faster, more interesting in terms of fees, more accessible in terms of mining and produces no harm to the environment. We're certain that SPARTA, just like ELDORADO, is marked for greatness!\n \nThis is all we got for today! We wish you a successful and positive week. Meanwhile, ELDORADO will continue to make you happy by its excellent operation. Join in, make donations, invite new users and build teams. Monthly 30% earnings and awesome bonuses are waiting for you! Remember: together we're changing the world! \ud83d\udc8e\n \nSincerely yours, ELDORADO Team!

You can find its description on a separate page now! \ud83d\ude4f\u2b50\nEven before we launched this project, we always said that ELDORADO was first of all about Ideology. This Club is a continuation of Sergey Mavrodi's idea of building a fair world where everyone will live in abundance. We used cutting-edge technology and made every effort to keep up our leader's idea and make it stronger even after his demise. This is how the ELDORADO System was created \u2014 as a huge money box available to everyone. We have now created a whole page with a detailed description of our Ideology. Review it, embrace it and take it to the masses. Ideology is the linchpin of the system. It's the major weapon in the fight against the unfair financial system.\nReview Ideology here:  https://eld.club/ideology.html \n \n2. The massive influx of new users is still on! We already have 4,000 users! Nearly 1,000 new users joined us in 3 days! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\nMore and more new users are joining us. Lots of them join the system on a daily basis. We have just celebrated having 3,000 users on Monday, and today we have nearly 4,000. It attests to three things: ads are working, leaders are working, and the System is working.  It's a wonderful trend, keep up the good work. Well done, y'all!\n \n3. Issues with SPARTA and SIGEN websites have been resolved. \u2705\ud83d\udc4c\nSPARTA's website is now available in all languages again, and Russian users can even open it without using VPN or a proxy server. The exchanger on the website is completely operational, and all issues on SIGEN's website were resolved on Monday, following a large-scale upgrade. So it's all operational \u2014 go ahead and review all details and start buying/selling.\nSPARTA website: https://sparta.top/index.html \nSIGEN: https://sigen.pro/\n \nThis is the positive information we've got for today, y'all! It's all good, and it's going to be a lot better. Make donations, invite new users \u2014 make an awesome profit and earn bonuses! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udfc6\n \nGreat future is reserved for all of us, but we've just started on this path. There's a long way ahead to creating a new financial world. However, if we tread confidently and actively and follow our Ideology \u2014 we will prevail! \ud83d\udc8e\u261d\n \nSincerely yours, ELDORADO Team!

We had hardly celebrated having 500 mln SPA in the box before we had almost 100 mln more in it. Just to remind you, the money box is an address where donations are sent and payments are made from. Moreover, forging is enabled for the money box and the amount of coins is increasing on its own. It means the System has now become even more stable! Follow the link to have a look at the money box \u2014\nhttps://blockchain.sparta.top/#/address/SPA13M4ezSHAEVG8v6rdH\n \nAs you can see, ELDORADO is doing just fine!
